<div class="the-modern-states">The modern State of Israel was established in 1948 after the end of the British Mandate in Palestine. The land had deep historical and religious significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. For Jews, it is their ancient homeland, where kingdoms of Israel and Judah once existed over 2,000 years ago.</div>
