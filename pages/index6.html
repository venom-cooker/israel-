		Israel is a small but diverse country located in the Middle East, on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Despite its size, it has a wide range of landscapes. In the north, there are green hills and mountains, like the Galilee and the Golan Heights, where the climate is mild and rainy in the winter.

<div class="in-the-centerrr">In the center of the country lies the coastal plain, where major cities like Tel Aviv and Haifa are located. This area is flat, warm, and highly populated. Moving east, the land rises into the mountains of Jerusalem, a city rich in history and culture.</div>
<div class="in-the-centerrr">Further south, the geography changes dramatically into the Negev Desert, which covers more than half of Israelâ€™s land. It is hot, dry, and rocky, but still home to many animals and plants adapted to desert life.</div>
</div>
<div class="to-the-east-container">
<p class="in-the-center">To the east, Israel borders the Jordan River and the Dead Sea, the lowest point on Earth. The Dead Sea is famous for its salty water that allows people to float effortlessly.</p>
<p class="in-the-center">Israel's geography shows how a small country can hold a rich variety of natural features and climates.</p>
